# Introduction

@cromignon has made an image for us in his [own repository](https://github.com/cromigon/ubooquity-docker), but doesn't seems to maintain it anymore.  
This image is built to be as lighweight and simple as possible. It is based on latest alpine and java 8.  

- **Ubooquity version** : 2.0.2

# Getting started

## Docker Installation

Please see the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details.

## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have folders created for the ubooquity config on the host.
It's generally recommended to have some e-books or comics to mount in :)

## Docker

Run the following command line :

```
docker run --restart=always -d \
  -v /PATH/TO/UBOOQUITY/DATA:/config \
  -v /PATH/TO/COMICSANDBOOKS:/media \
  -p 2202:2202 \
  -p 2502:2502 \
  zerpex/ubooquity-docker
  
```


## Docker-compose

Use the following docker-compose.yml and adapt it to you configuration :

```
ubooquity:
  restart: always
  image: zerpex/ubooquity-docker
  container_name: ubooquity
    - /PATH/TO/UBOOQUITY/CONFIG:/config
    - /PATH/TO/YOUR/COMICS:/media
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
  environment:
    - TZ=Europe/Paris
  ports:
    - 2202:2202
    - 2502:2502

```

## Notes

Once the container is up:  
- go to http://{YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}:2502/admin and do your configuration according to the [ubooquity documentation](https://vaemendis.github.io/ubooquity-doc/).  
- Then, you can access Ubooquity through http://{YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}:2202
- In order to keep your containers up to date automatically, I recommand you to use [Watchtower](https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower) that will do the job for you :)
